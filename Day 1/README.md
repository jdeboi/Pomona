Day 1
===============

**Project**: Build an energy-saving temperature alarm for use in the new Millikan. 
1. Start by programming the blinking LED alarm.
2. Add a button to turn the alarm on/off.
3. Build and calibrate the thermistor circuit.
4. Reprogram the button to toggle the season so that in the winter, temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius trigger the alarm; in the summer, temperatures below 25 trigger the alarm. 
5. Add an RGB LED to indicate how much energy is being saved (a color gradient from red to green).
6. (optional) Convert the room temperature alarm to a tea-kettle alarm.
7. (optional) Add a speaker and tone library to add complexity to the alarm system; when the tea is done, whistle!
